## The Edge: One Screen for the AI Tape

Leadership in AI equities flips in minutes; by the time a headline lands, the trade is often stale. This dashboard gives you a clean, minute-bar read of the tape: momentum, liquidity (shares and dollar value traded), volatility, and trend across the names that set the pace. 


We structure the market into **AI Silicon & Hardware**: [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/), [Advanced Micro Devices](https://www.amd.com/), [Broadcom](https://www.broadcom.com/), [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company](https://www.tsmc.com/), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/), and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/). **Cloud AI Platforms**: [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google), [Meta Platforms](https://about.meta.com/), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/), and [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/), and the **[Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ)](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/aiq/)** as a breadth check. On one screen, you can spot price and volume rotation early, see where participation is real versus thin, and track capital as it moves now, not yesterday.


## Why Real-Time Market Intelligence Matters

In today's hyper-connected markets, information asymmetry creates opportunity but only for those who can process signals faster than the crowd. Traditional market analysis relies on end-of-day data and backward-looking metrics. By the time most investors see a trend, institutional money has already moved.

Our AI Market Pulse dashboard changes that dynamic. By processing minute-bar data in real-time and structuring it around the AI value chain, we give you the tools to:

- **Spot rotation early**: See capital moving between chip stocks and cloud platforms before broader markets catch on
- **Validate conviction**: Distinguish between genuine institutional accumulation and retail noise
- **Time entry and exit**: Use volatility and volume patterns to optimize trade timing
- **Monitor breadth**: Track whether AI leadership is broadening or narrowing through ETF divergence

## Segment Scan: Where the AI Money's Moving

The main view is designed to read flow, breadth, and rotation at a glance. It groups the trade into three lenses that mirror the AI stack: **AI Silicon & Hardware** (NVDA, AMD, AVGO, TSM, INTC, AAPL), **Cloud AI Platforms** (MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, ORCL, PLTR), and the AI-thematic ETF **AIQ** as a breadth barometer. Each segment pairs an average price index with minute-by-minute volume participation, so you can judge both direction and conviction.

Trend cards show each ticker's price by the minute, while the combined line-and-bar chart plots the segment's average price index (line) against total traded volume (bars). In practice, synchronized volume across chip names often precedes capex-cycle narratives and ETF follow-through; sustained price-plus-volume in the cloud cohort signals attach-rate or workload shifts; and whether AIQ tracks or diverges from those segments tells you if flows are broadening or leadership is narrowing.

## Drilling Down: The Stock View

Click any trend card to open the Deep View, where the tape turns into a full diagnostic. A P/E ratio gauge anchors valuation at a glance, while a multi-axis line chart lets you see price, volume, and volatility move together minute by minute. At the top, the Ticker and Date filters reframe the window instantly.

Every metric and line updates in step, so you can test whether a burst in price was backed by real participation or just noise. When price lifts with rising volume and contained volatility, you're likely seeing constructive accumulation; when price runs with spiking volatility and fading volume, the move can be fragile. The Deep View turns a headline into a read on how the move happened so you can act with context, not guesses.

## Metabase as the Semantic Front End

[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) enables a rapid, disciplined build that aligns with how analysts actually work. Models provide a semantic layer so KPI definitions are written once and reused across cards, avoiding version drift. Native SQL support allows fast iteration as market structure or requirements evolve, while filters and field pickers keep the interface intuitive for non-technical users. 

Visuals are clean and shareable; public links and embeds carry the exact same governed metrics to stakeholders without extra engineering. In short, it turns a sound data model into a decision-ready surface with minimal friction.

## From Market Prints to Decisions: Cloud Intelligence's Edge

[Cloud Intelligence](https://cloudintelligence.africa/) turns raw market prints into investor-grade insight. We run production ingestion from Yahoo Finance API, apply idempotent upserts and late-bar reconciliation, and store minute bars in Google Cloud Postgres engineered for speed. On top, [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) Models define shared KPIs: momentum, dollar value traded, rolling volatility, and P/E so every view speaks the same language across research, trading, and reporting.

The result is decision-centric analytics: a one-screen tape for flow, breadth, and rotation; a deep view that explains how a move happened; and governed metrics that travel cleanly to stakeholders. You get faster time-to-insight, fewer data disputes, and durable dashboards that scale with your universe so attention stays on alpha and risk, not on plumbing.


## The Technical Architecture Behind the Insights

Building a real-time financial dashboard requires more than just connecting to market data. Our architecture handles the complexities of financial data ingestion while maintaining the speed and reliability that trading decisions demand.

**Data Ingestion Layer**: Yahoo Finance API provides minute-bar OHLC data, volume, and fundamental metrics. Our ingestion pipeline handles market hours, handles late prints, and manages data quality checks automatically.

**Storage & Processing**: Google Cloud Postgres with optimized schemas for time-series queries. Minute bars are stored with proper indexing for fast windowed calculations, while derived metrics (rolling averages, volatility measures) are pre-calculated and updated in real-time.

**Semantic Layer**: [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) Models ensure that momentum calculations, dollar volume metrics, and volatility measures are defined once and used consistently across all visualizations. This eliminates the "which number is right?" problem that plagues many financial dashboards.
