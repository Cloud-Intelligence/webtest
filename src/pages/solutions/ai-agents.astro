        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are AI agents and how do they work?</h3>
          <p>AI agents are autonomous software programs that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They use machine learning algorithms to understand context, process information, and execute tasks without constant human supervision.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How quickly can AI agents be deployed in my business?</h3>
          <p>Deployment typically takes 4-8 weeks depending on complexity. We start with a discovery phase to understand your workflows, then build, test, and deploy custom agents tailored to your specific business needs. Simple automation agents can be deployed in as little as 2 weeks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What tasks can AI agents automate?</h3>
          <p>AI agents excel at customer service inquiries, data analysis and reporting, document processing, workflow coordination, inventory management, lead qualification, and repetitive decision-making tasks. They're particularly effective for tasks that require consistency and are rule-based.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do AI agents integrate with existing systems?</h3>
          <p>Our AI agents integrate seamlessly with your existing software stack through APIs, webhooks, and custom connectors. We ensure compatibility with CRMs, ERPs, databases, and communication platforms while maintaining data security and compliance standards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the ROI of implementing AI agents?</h3>
          <p>Most clients see 3-5x ROI within the first year through reduced operational costs, improved efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction. AI agents typically reduce task completion time by 70-90% while maintaining consistent quality and availability 24/7.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do you ensure AI agents make accurate decisions?</h3>
          <p>We implement comprehensive training protocols, continuous monitoring, and feedback loops. Agents are trained on your specific data and business rules, with built-in safeguards and escalation procedures for complex scenarios requiring human oversight.</p>
