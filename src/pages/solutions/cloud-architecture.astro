        <p>
          Our cloud architecture services help organizations modernize their infrastructure with scalable, 
          secure, and cost-effective solutions. From microservices to serverless computing, we design 
          architectures that support rapid innovation while maintaining operational excellence.

      <div class="faq-grid">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What cloud platforms do you specialize in?</h3>
          <p>We work with all major cloud providers including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and hybrid multi-cloud environments. Our architects are certified across platforms and select the best fit based on your requirements, existing infrastructure, and business objectives.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do you approach cloud migration projects?</h3>
          <p>We follow a systematic approach: assessment of current infrastructure, migration strategy development (rehost, refactor, rearchitect), pilot migrations, gradual rollout, and optimization. We minimize downtime and ensure business continuity throughout the migration process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can you help with cost optimization?</h3>
          <p>Yes, we implement cost optimization strategies including right-sizing resources, reserved instances, spot instances, auto-scaling, serverless adoption, and multi-cloud cost arbitrage. We provide ongoing monitoring and recommendations to maintain cost efficiency as you scale.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do you ensure security in cloud architectures?</h3>
          <p>We implement defense-in-depth security including network segmentation, identity and access management (IAM), encryption at rest and in transit, security monitoring, compliance frameworks, and zero-trust architecture principles. All designs follow cloud security best practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the difference between microservices and monolithic architecture?</h3>
          <p>Microservices break applications into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately. This offers better scalability, technology diversity, and fault isolation compared to monolithic architectures, but requires more sophisticated orchestration and monitoring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you provide ongoing support and optimization?</h3>
          <p>Yes, we offer comprehensive managed services including 24/7 monitoring, performance optimization, security updates, capacity planning, disaster recovery, and continuous cost optimization. Our support ensures your cloud infrastructure evolves with your business needs.</p>
